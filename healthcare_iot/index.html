			<b>Abstract:</b> The collection, storage, manipulation, analysis and retention of massive amounts of data have resulted in new technologies including big data analytics and data science. It is now possible to analyze massive amounts of data and extract useful nuggets and make predictions with machine learning techniques. However, the collection and manipulation of this data has also resulted in serious security and privacy considerations. Various regulations are being proposed to handle big data so that the privacy of the individuals is not violated. Furthermore, the data being stored may also be vulnerable to cyber-attacks. <br>
			
Machine Learning and Security are being integrated to solve security and privacy challenges. For example, machine learning techniques are being applied to solve security problems such as malware analysis and insider threat detection. However, there is also a concern that the machine learning techniques themselves could be attacked. Therefore, the machine learning techniques are being adapted to handle adversarial attacks.  Furthermore, due to privacy violations caused by machine learning, privacy enhanced machine learning techniques are being developed. <br>
			
To assess the developments on the integration of Data Science/Machine Learning and Security over the past decade and apply them to the Internet of Transportation, the presentation will focus on three aspects. First it will examine the developments on applying Data Science techniques for detecting cyber security problems such as insider threat detection as well as the handling attacks to machine learning techniques. Some developments on privacy aware and policy-based data management frameworks will also be discussed. Second it will discuss the developments on securing the Internet of Transportation and its supporting infrastructures and examine the privacy implications. Finally, it will describe ways in which Big Data, Data Science and Security could be incorporated into the Internet of Transportation and Infrastructures.

		<b>Abstract:</b> We propose Auracle, a wearable earpiece that can automatically recognize eating behavior. More specifically, in free-living conditions, we can recognize when and for how long a person is eating. Using an off-the-shelf contact microphone placed behind the ear, Auracle captures the sound of a person chewing as it passes through the bone and tissue of the head. This audio data is then processed by a custom analog/digital circuit board. To ensure reliable (yet comfortable) contact between microphone and skin, all hardware components are incorporated into a 3D-printed behind-the-head framework. We collected field data with 14 participants for 32 hours in free-living conditions and additional eating data with 10 participants for 2 hours in a laboratory setting. We achieved accuracy exceeding 92.8% and F1 score exceeding 77.5% for eating detection. Moreover, Auracle successfully detected 20-24 eating episodes (depending on the metrics) out of 26 in free-living conditions. We demonstrate that our custom device could sense, process, and classify audio data in real time. Additionally, we estimate Auracle can last 28.1 hours with a 110 mAh battery while communicating its observations of eating behavior to a smartphone over Bluetooth.
